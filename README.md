#### **2. Philosophical Thought in "Die Welt von gestern"/ "The World of Yesterday": Crisis of Humanism**

  - Zweig laments how **liberalism and humanism failed in the face of authoritarianism**.  
  - The once vibrant **Viennese culture** (freedom, art, intellectual fusion) was replaced by **nationalism and tyranny**.  

- **Nihilism and Nostalgia:**  
  - Zweig, as a **witness of cultural decay**, nostalgically reflects on the lost **spirit of creativity and freedom**.  
  - He perceives the **modern world as unstable and transient**, contrasting with the secure cultural haven of pre-war Vienna.  

- **The Helplessness of the Individual:**  
  - Deeply feels the **powerlessness of intellectuals** against political violence and ideological extremism.  
  - As a cosmopolitan humanist, he struggles to reconcile his **identity in an increasingly fragmented Europe**.  

- **The Disillusionment of Freedom:**
